# Machine Vision

## Introduction

Machine vision is the technology and methods used to provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection, process control, and robot guidance, usually in industry. In industrial environments there are many moving parts and by associating them, there will be workers working along with machines. Ensuring safety and security of workers and machines is very important.

## Problem Description

Main objectives of the project is to build a real time object collision detection pipeline. Couple object detection and trajectory prediction modules together and run inference on the coupled pipeline in real time. Taking video from a source as input and run inference using pipeline on this video and predict trajectories and objects in real time.

Implementing a multi view based object collision system using the predicted trajectories which used object detection module outputs as inputs.

### Credits

This project is part of my academic curriculum MTP (M. Tech Project), which I pursued under the guidance of Prof. P. K. Biswas, ECE Department, IIT KGP, and with the help of my reasearch engineer guide Vivek Raj.
